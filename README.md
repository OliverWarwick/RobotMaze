# RobotMaze
1st year programming project, controlling a robot to move through a maze.

# Intro
No longer have access to the enviroment to run the code in, but the java files show how I decided to tackle the problem. Using the Tremaux algorithm
for solving loopy mazes the code records the possition and unexplored exits for each junction it visits. And by following the algorithm
we ensure the robot does not get stuck in any loops. Once the first run has been completed the program holds the route for that maze
allowing for quick solving of the same problem.
